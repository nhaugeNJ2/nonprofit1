            <h1><br>About REELS</h1>
            <p>"REELS" is an acronym that stands for "Recording of Events by
							Enthusiasts in Local Schools." The owner and founder of this
							non-profit organization, Natalie Hauge, spent her junior and
							senior year of high school in a digital entrepreneurship class at
							Heartland Technical Academy at Richland Community College in
							Decatur, Illinois and still utilizes to this day the knowledge
							and tactics in the audio-visual field that she had been educated
							in during that class. She then attended Millikin University and
							earned a degree in video production in their Arts and Technology
							department.
							<br>
							<br>
							REELS's ultimate "missions" are these three things. One mission is
							to help high school and college students get into the career paths
							of the film and media world. Although the student volunteers are
							not paid with money, they're rewarded with new entries they can
							add to their resumes: professional work experience in the
							audio-visual field as well as the volunteer entry everyone needs.
							It would help them to get a job in the industry in the future.
							Another mission is to help schools and other businesses raise
							money through fundraisers.
							<br>
							<br>
							The third mission is to improve upon the documentation of events
							and happenings in our state of Illinois. In the past, if they were
							taped at all, it was only with the use of a single, overview,
							far-away, low-quality shot that may be hard to see and sometimes
							wouldn't even play as a sold DVD copy.

			Natalie created this organization upon her personal experience.
			Her sister used to dance at the Dance Centre in Decatur when she
			was younger, was a member of the Mount Zion Poms Squad, and was
			both a dancer and a dance teacher at Richland Community College in
			Decatur. Her family would always buy a DVD copy if the recitals
			were recorded. However, Richland wasn't always taped, and the
			Dance Centre DVDs would either malfunction, break, not play, only
			play certain dances or just one act, or just plain not work at
			all. Additionally, a Dance Centre performance was sometimes filmed
			with such a poor-quality camera that you could not even tell who
			was who in the video. And watching the Poms Squad on the football
			field, it got Natalie thinking how if the school had a big crew of
			camera workers to tape the event, then they'd be able to not only
			create videos of good quality and changing angles, but more
			importantly, the videos would be able to be edited to focus on
			just one individual student playing or dancing at the game. Each
			individual could then buy his or her own copy of the game, but a
			particular edited copy that would be just about him or her.
